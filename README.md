ScreenshotSaver for Nook Simple Touch

takes a screenshot every 1:50 to use as a screensaver.

After launching ScreenshotSaver for the first time, go to the device's settings and change the screensaver to ScreenshotSaver.
To stop ScreenshotSaver from running, launch it again.

Due to the weird color bug of the NST's buitin /system/bin/screenshot program,
ScreenshotSaver instead ships with and uses the fb2png program, from <https://code.google.com/p/android-fb2png/>
